*******HW 6 Notes*******

1) External command called "record" 
	when called: records day/time stamp of any command line you type
	text file name will be a parameter when calling record command
	each new line will start with a time stamp (time() or ctime()
	then input will be recorded to the text file

	record will stop with "ctrl-d" 
	the executable file for "record" will be placed in newly added "bin" subdirectory in "shell" project
			("cvs add" to add "bin" subdirectory to repository)
	modify "makefile" to put executable file "record" in "bin" file
	"record.c" will be in src subdirectory

	add "~/csc60/a6/shell/bin to "PATH" variable in ".bashrc" file 
		source it with "~/.bashrc" 
	copy .bashrc to "a6" directory for grading

2)Key-logging
	internal command named "key_logger"
	dedicate pipe. 
	should be in main function: key-logging of command line by sending them through the pipe to child process running "record" code
	then send input to parse() as normal

	a) when "key_logger" is typed a child process will be created and commands typed from keyboard will be passed to child process through a pipe
	   child process in executable "record" file in bin subdirectory
	   "record" will be reading commands from stdin so use dup() or dup2() and execlp() or execvp() 
	   pass name of temporary key logging file, ".temp_logger" to child process through exec(). 
	   permanent key-loggin file will be called ".logfile" in shell directory

	b) when "key_logger_off" is input the logging will stop
	   ".temp_logger" will be appended to permanent ".logfile"
	   delete temp file
	   OR when shell is shut down, use atexit()
	   ".logfile" will be in simpleshell sessions, not in cvs

	c) handle "SIGINT" signal
	   ctrl-C will prompt an option to append temp_logger to perm or not
		if yes..append file
		if no...delete temp and exit simpleshell
	
Modify makefile, test. 
Make clean, copy .bashrc to a6, commit as 7.1, tar, submit
